More ideas, wikipedia is a gold mine!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- witch has to turn invaders into creatures to protect her island/cottage/hut
- command based transformation spell (i.e., sequence; think SF's hadouken)
- each spell transform invaders in a type of creature
  - it also only works on a single creature
  - think jan-ken-po

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- voluntary transformation, but caster mind is slowly taken by the creature's
